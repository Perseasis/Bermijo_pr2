                Typography as Art: Scher is known for her bold, oversized typography that often acts as the focal point of her designs. She frequently uses type in innovative, unexpected ways, distorting, stacking, or bending letters to create visual impact. Her typography isn't just a vehicle for conveying information; it becomes a sculptural, visual element in the overall composition. <br>
                
                Vivid Color Palettes: Her use of vibrant, high-contrast colors adds energy and emotion to her designs. The combination of strong, saturated hues—often in unexpected pairings—gives her work a playful, sometimes chaotic aesthetic.

                Layering and Depth: Scher often employs layers of text and graphic elements that build a sense of depth and complexity. Her compositions can feel crowded or busy, but this density contributes to the visual intrigue and reinforces the idea of storytelling through visual means.
                <br>
                Geometric and Abstract Elements: While her designs can often seem somewhat chaotic, they also display a strong sense of geometry. Her work features an interplay of shapes—whether in the form of grids, abstract patterns, or asymmetrical compositions—that adds a structural quality to the freeform typography.
